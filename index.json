Rich, developed nations like the United States have the means, and arguably the obligation, to lead the pace of transition. What will it take for the United States to build a net-zero emissions energy system? Why is a 100% carbon-free electricity system pivotal to this challenge? What role do technologies like wind, solar, batteries, nuclear, and carbon capture play in this future? Prof. Jenkins will summarize the decarbonization challenge in the American context, drawing on recent publications and preliminary findings of Princeton\u0026rsquo;s Net-Zero America Project, which is mapping pathways for the United States to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\nUseful Links\nGetting to Zero: Can America Transition to a Net-Zero Emissions Energy System?\nThe Energy Systems Analysis Group (ESAG), Princeton University\nCarbon Mitigation Initiative (CMI), Princeton University\nEvolved Energy Research, Near-term advising on long-term energy transition\n","date":1585195200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585195200,"objectID":"a6be7d8c775d2f67a568a71c9fb6255e","permalink":"/project/net-zero-america-project/","publishdate":"2020-03-26T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/net-zero-america-project/","section":"project","summary":"Identify pathways to accelerate decarbonization of US national energy system","tags":["Energy System","Modelling and Optimization","Decarbonization","Energy Policy"],"title":"Net Zero America Project","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Integrating digital tools into the world’s energy systems could reduce carbon emissions by more than 50 per cent, a recent review has found. Decarbonising the world’s energy systems is a crucial part of mitigating climate change through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. While decarbonisation is non-negotiable if climate breakdown is to be halted, it must be balanced with ensuring economic stability and a smooth transition to sustainable energy. Digital technologies such as big data, machine learning and the Internet of Things hold immense potential to help us meet this challenge. Their applications range from helping to reduce our power bills by employing smart meters in the home, to assisting with peer-to-peer energy trading between power stations via blockchain.\nAn international team of researchers from the UK, USA, Switzerland and Singapore found that while the existing digital technologies have numerous and effective applications when considered individually, the potential reduction of carbon emissions is multiplied when they are combined. Such combinations are called cyber-physical systems – interacting networks of physical infrastructure and computers that allow for smarter analysis, decision-making and optimisation of energy systems. Introducing artificial intelligence (AI) into these cyber-physical systems can lead to even more carbon savings (a total of 20 per cent with only cyber-physical systems and an extra 30 per cent when AI is included). This combination of technologies creates what is dubbed “intelligent cyber-physical systems”; benefits include more resilient infrastructure and operational flexibility, among others.\nForecasting of particular renewable energies is one good example of an intelligent cyber-physical system. The wind and solar energy sectors have seen much growth and while the price of these technologies has reduced, the intermittent nature of this type of power has limited their application. The integration of backup energy systems (natural gas plants, for example) or energy storage technologies is required. Intelligent cyber-physical technologies, in particular machine learning, could help with this integration through improved forecasting of solar and wind variability. Other large energy systems such as power plants can also benefit. When applied to carbon capture and storage plants, for example, these technologies can convert operational data into actionable intelligence, thereby reducing costs and improving energy efficiency through improved processes.\nOf particular importance in this work is a revised marginal abatement cost curve (MACC). MACCs illustrate both the cost and potential of various carbon dioxide reduction strategies and are used by policy makers to assess which to pursue. The integration of cyber-physical systems is a substantial update to the MACC and further establishes it as an indispensable tool for those working on decarbonisation. Cyber-physical systems, especially those combined with AI, provide the much-needed boost required for countries to meet their decarbonisation and emissions targets. It is now up to policy makers to take this forward by incentivising the deployment of these technologies to combat climate change.\nReference\nOliver Inderwildi, Chuan Zhang, Xiaonan Wang, and Markus Kraft.

To explore what technologies, policies, market designs and planning strategies will increase the likelihood that state and ISO can decarbonize their electricity supply; we have conducted a project assessing the role of New Jersey (NJ) in the deep decarbonization of PJM gird, which is the regional transmission organization responsible for electricity supply of 13 states in upper east coast of US. In this project, we strive to understand understanding how to maximize benefits and minimize costs associated with the deployment of 3500 MW of offshore wind (OSW) electricity generating capacity to be installed off the NJ coast. In the project, we first identify the optimal backbone transmission requirement to accommodate NJ’s projected 3500 MW of OSW, and then identify interregional backbone transmission requirements to accommodate 15000 MW of OSW projected for PJM. In the second step, we use the planned OSW resources, together with transmission configurations identified in step 1, as inputs to simulations of the evolution of the supply resource mix (including capacity retirements and additions), to assessments of wholesale market prices and revenues expected to accrue to OSW resources, and to emission reductions estimates. We use GenX, an electricity capacity expansion model in Julia, to study the evolution of the resource mix and simulate wholesale market outcomes. Since the evolution of the resource mix substantially depends on capacity factors and capital cost of generation resources, higher capacity factors justify investment in higher capital cost resources. In that case, technology-cost sensitivity analysis is conducted: in baseline scenarios, the cost of OSW is based on middle-range values from annual technology baseline of NREL; in high/low technology cost cases, we varied that to low-range and high-range respectively. Moreover, the change of electrification, in particular heat pump for residential heating and electric vehicles, is investigated in the study as well. Finally, we evaluate the sensitivity of our assessments to anticipated market design enhancements, including fast-start pricing in the energy market and clean Minimum Offer Pricing Rule (clean-MOPR).

Interestingly, every time I said “I work on energy” or something like that, I was in trouble. Depending on the background of your fellow, they may have quite different perspectives on what energy is and what is energy research about: if you are talking to material scientist, they could think energy is all about developing better electrode materials which could result in high-performance batteries; if you are talking to chemist, they might think energy is basically about finding novel catalysts or reaction path which would turn CO2 into fossil fuels (this is exactly my girlfriend does); if you are talking to electric engineers, they might think energy is about resilient power grid which could accommodate more renewable generation; and so on so force. They are all correct in the sense that if they manage to fully unleash their research potential at industrial scale, the energy trilemma could be largely tackled. However, we have to admit that although scientists worldwide have achieved impressive progresses in these domains, the overall landscape of energy conversion and utilization has not changed much since industrial revolution.\nThe Sankey diagram of 2019 energy use in U.S. clearly shows that the bulk of global energy consumption still comes from fossil fuel.However, in pathways limiting global warming to 1.5oC, global total CO2 emission are reduced to net zero around 2050. In such a context, it becomes very important to unleash the potential from intra-system re-innovation, I mean together with fundamental changes of component level performance leap, some priority should be given to system level design and optimization which would make the performance of each single component at their best value. Of course, this is not easy because on one side, the energy system landscape (what technologies are used, how they are designed and operated etc.) has been there for decades with high techno-institutional inertial that are quite difficult to overcome; on the other side, I think this research direction has not been paid much attention compared to other aspects. A key lesson I have learned from my energy system study is the complexity and interdisciplinary nature of energy transition. Factors that can accelerate the decarbonization of energy system are diverse, including industrial bottlenecks (technological challenges, natural resource availability and constraints in material supplies and manufacturing capacity), regulatory limitations, economic forces and fiscal constraints, political constraints and goal, collective action problems, consumer preferences and fears, lack of public acceptance, rational and irrational influences on public and private investment decisions, and others. Solving these intertwined challenges will requires co-analysis of economic, engineering, environmental, and social factors that originated from many fields spanning the natural, social, and engineering, sciences. The chanllenge is amplified by the fact that there is no scientific community that specialized on this topic, energy researchers are from various backgrounds with their own basis, so they only justify the soundness of their disciplinary basis. In a recent paper on Joulejournal, some researchers from Stanford University address this issue. In the paper, they proposed a new terminology for the science of energy transition, which require multi-disciplinary innovations across multi-scale in the energy system landscape. I personally could not agree more and again, I really think promoting systematic analysis in energy transition would be critical for the success of solving such grand chanllenges for human beings. I here call for more attention to this exciting new research area.\nReference\nPatricia J. Levi, Simon Davidsson Kurland, Michael Carbajales-Dale, John P. Weyant, Adam R. Brandt, Sally M.

It is shown through this study that KBS can bridge the communication gaps between different companies in EIP, sequentially more potential Industrial Symbiosis (IS) links can be established to improve the overall energy efficiency of the whole EIP.","tags":[],"title":"Knowledge management of eco-industrial park for efficient energy utilization through ontology-based approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chuan Zhang","Alessandro Romagnoli","Markus Kraft"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1508297255,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1508297255,"objectID":"61b55466d01397ddeb63256c2e6bb6ab","permalink":"/publication/2017_sdewes/","publishdate":"2017-10-18T11:27:35+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2017_sdewes/","section":"publication","summary":"A novel framework for the optimization of industrial cogeneration system under real-time energy commodity market is proposed in this paper.

Design parameters and operational parameters are described separately in the formulation so that system design problem and system operation problem can be differentiated; operational parameters are further divided into process parameters (e.g. pressure, temperature and flow rate of raw material streams) and economic parameters (e.g. price of raw material).

The proposed formulation could accommodate both system synthesis problem at the design stage and system scheduling problem at the operation stage; moreover, the proposed optimization formulation can dynamically react to real-time energy prices, which could significantly increase the cogeneration system operational efficiency economically.","tags":[],"title":"Surrogate model based optimization of industrial cogeneration system under real-time energy commodity market","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chuan Zhang","Li Zhou","Alessandro Romagnoli","Markus Kraft"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1503026855,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1503026855,"objectID":"b692416249bc5b4f03facbb006e6c47a","permalink":"/publication/2017_icae/","publishdate":"2017-08-18T11:27:35+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2017_icae/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents new insights into constructing a cyber-infrastructure system, called J-Park Simulator, for the resource and energy management of eco-industrial parks.

Particularly, urban energy system is also experiencing digital transition; such digital transition not only offers new business models commercially, but also brings new research problems scientifically. The new capabilities enabled by these digital technologies are reshaping the generation, transmission, consumption and storage sections in the urban energy system, sequentially the traditional way of how urban energy system is designed and operated should be reexamined. Starting from here, there have been many studies regarding how various digital technologies can be applied all along the urban energy system value chain; these studies range from individuals’ energy consumption pattern characterization by using customer behavior data in smart home, to complex data-driven planning of regional scale energy system. More specifically, numerous computational models have been proposed by the scientific community to mimic the dynamics of various components at various levels in the urban energy system. However, the potential benefits of applying these numerical models are somehow underestimated; we believe there are still several gaps from numerical modeling to computational intelligence which need to be bridged. In such a context, in this paper we strive to present a systematic review on the status of urban energy system related digital innovations as well as prospective outlook on the future application of such digital technologies. Through the study of this paper, we hope to identify several key points where digitalization should be prioritized in urban energy system, picture a roadmap towards future digital technology enabled intelligent urban energy system, and finally points out the research gaps that need to be fulfilled over there.","tags":[],"title":"From numerical model to computational intelligence: The digital transition of urban energy system","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chuan Zhang","Alessandro Romagnoli","Andrew Lindsay"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1500348455,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1500348455,"objectID":"abb80658e3b89ef41ef316628bc9bd2d","permalink":"/publication/2017_waste_heat_power_policy/","publishdate":"2017-07-18T11:27:35+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2017_waste_heat_power_policy/","section":"publication","summary":"As an important way to increase industrial energy efficiency, Waste Heat to Power (WHP) technologies have been gaining popularity in recent years. In order to appraise the market potential of WHP technologies in Southeast Asia, a techno-economic assessment for WHP technologies is conducted in this paper. The technical and economic market potential of WHP in Southeast Asia is estimated to be 1788 MW and 1188 MW respectively. The main market drivers and barriers for WHP market expansion in Southeast Asia are also analyzed. Given the fact that WHP is a far cheaper power generation technology as compared with traditional and renewable power generation, the WHP market is expected to increase fast in the coming years. Mounting electricity price from grid, government emissions regulations and subsidies, the integration of WHP products with original equipment manufacturer, capital cost reduction induced by technology development are identified as the key drivers for the market growth. The above arguments are proofed through the analysis of a power plant WHP project in Southeast Asia.","tags":[],"title":"Implementation of industrial waste heat to power in Southeast Asia: an outlook from the perspective of market potentials, opportunities and success catalysts","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In the future scenario of Industrial 4.0 and IoT, information exchange could be totally different from what it is now. The current data integration approaches that need large-scale human intervention will not be suitable in such application contexts. Considering the fact that vast and heterogeneous data exists in future, traditional human-based approaches may need to deal with large amount of information every day, which would result in huge human resources to be consumed. Hence developing ontology based approach that can properly handle the complex and unstructured big data seems to be a promising trend in the future scenario of Industrial 4.0. Ontology is an indispensable ingredient for such applications: ontology contains core concepts as well as the relationships between the concepts within the domain of discourse; also the syntax and semantics of ontology is both human-readable and machine-interpretable to enable effective communication not only between people, but also between machines. In this context, ontology-based approach becomes a perfect candidate due to its abilities in tackling these problems.\nUseful Links\nJ-Park Simulator, A Part of The World Avatar Project\nCambridge Centre for Advanced Research and Education in Singapore (CARES)\nComputational Modelling Group, University of Cambridge\nOntoCAPE, A large-scale ontology for chemical process engineering\n","date":1490846400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1490846400,"objectID":"472e9044d47cc8c61a372284e8aee216","permalink":"/project/energy-informatics/","publishdate":"2017-03-30T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/energy-informatics/","section":"project","summary":"Energy informatics for efficient energy management system","tags":["Energy System","Decarbonization","AI"],"title":"Energy informatics","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Embed your slides or video here using shortcodes.

Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) in EIP can significantly increase the total energy efficiency of the whole park, meanwhile reducing its greenhouse gas emission. The current paper proposes a methodology to assess the opportunities of WHR in EIP at park level. Four different steps are included in this methodology. The first step is identification of waste heat source plants and sink plants in EIP; the second step is the establishment of the waste heat transportation system; the third step is a Single-Objective Optimization Problem (SOOP); the fourth step is Multi-Objective Optimization Problem (MOOP). An EIP on Jurong Island Singapore comprising of five plants and two communities is used as a case study to demonstrate the capability of this methodology. Two different operation modes for the EIP are considered: with continuous waste heat and with discontinuous waste heat over time. The first scenario shows that SOOP and MOOP will deliver different WHR networks; the second scenario shows that waste heat discontinuity has great influence on the optimization of the WHR network.","tags":[],"title":"A novel methodology for the design of waste heat recovery network in eco-industrial park using techno-economic analysis and multi-objective optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chuan Zhang","Alessandro Romagnoli","Markus Kraft"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1476761255,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1476761255,"objectID":"97f4f7baec46392e9765d69f4114c6c8","permalink":"/publication/2016_icae/","publishdate":"2016-10-18T11:27:35+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2016_icae/","section":"publication","summary":"An ontology-based approach for thermal energy management of eco-industrial park is proposed in this paper.

Indeed, an EIP could be among the most energy-intensive areas of a country, correspondingly waste heat will also account for a considerable proportion. For instance, it is reported that the Yeosu National Industrial Complex in South Korea consumes 15% of the total energy of the country, while producing 47% of the total industrial waste heat. In EIP the geographical proximity between different users offers new possibilities for WHR; in fact, some waste heat that does not have end-user in one plant may be used in another, therefore WHR network can be formulated. In such cases, the plant supplying heat is defined as source plant, whereas the plant receiving heat is defined as sink plant. Besides, if the waste heat from source plants can be used by neighboring communities, the overall energy efficiency of EIP can be further improved through urban-industrial symbiosis. The optimization of WHR network at EIP level (inter-plant) is quite different from the optimization of WHR at single plant level (intra-plant). Currently the popular method used for WHR optimization in EIP is linear/nonlinear programming based on objective functions and constrains. The current research activity still presents room to improve in the following areas:\n The multiple criteria decision-making. Various objective functions, including energy efficiency of the EIP, payback period of the WHR network, CO2 emission reduction etc. have been proposed in the literature, as a result different WHR network scenarios can be selected. Yet the attempt to satisfy multiple and possibly conflicting objectives simultaneously is seldom discussed. The analysis of waste heat transportation system. The temperature drop and energy loss during waste heat transportation has been mentioned in some papers, yet the configuration of the waste heat transportation system has not been discussed in detail. The influence of intermittent waste heat on the optimization process. Almost all existing studies assume constant waste heat profile, but this may not be the case for some batch processes. For such processes, the waste heat profile could vary over time, thus influencing the performance of the WHR network; therefore, the intermittency of waste heat also merits to be investigated.
