      <description>Understanding the underlying dynamics of building energy consumption is the very firrst step towards energy saving in building sector; as a powerful tool for knowledge discovery, data mining is being applied to this domain more and more frequently. However, most previous researchers focus on model development during the pipeline of data mining, with feature engineering simply being overlooked. To fill this gap, three different feature engineering approaches, namely Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) as a feature visualization method, Random Forest (RF) as a feature selection method and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a feature extraction method, are investigated in the paper.</description>

      <description>The project presents a novel integrated assessment model by combining bottom-up techno-economic model, metamodel, vintage stock model, and technology learning curve, based on updated aggregated plant-level data. Essentially, this study answers the following questions: What are the practical limits that various techniques could provide in fossil fuel power plant decarbonization (e.g. ton CO2 reduction)? How much are the corresponding change of levelized cost of electricity (e.g. $ per MWh electricity) and CO2 mitigation costs (e.</description>

      <description>Based on the concept of industrial symbiosis, which describes the combination of physically or virtually connected businesses within a certain area in a mutually beneficial way, the concept of Eco Industrial Park (EIP) has been brought forward to achieve maximum productivity with minimum cost of resources. Indeed, an EIP could be among the most energy-intensive areas of a country, correspondingly waste heat will also account for a considerable proportion. For instance, it is reported that the Yeosu National Industrial Complex in South Korea consumes 15% of the total energy of the country, while producing 47% of the total industrial waste heat.</description>
