      <description>Based on the concept of industrial symbiosis, which describes the combination of physically or virtually connected businesses within a certain area in a mutually beneficial way, the concept of Eco Industrial Park (EIP) has been brought forward to achieve maximum productivity with minimum cost of resources. Indeed, an EIP could be among the most energy-intensive areas of a country, correspondingly waste heat will also account for a considerable proportion. For instance, it is reported that the Yeosu National Industrial Complex in South Korea consumes 15% of the total energy of the country, while producing 47% of the total industrial waste heat.</description>
