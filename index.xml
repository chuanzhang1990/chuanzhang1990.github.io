      <title>Energy: the importance of system analysis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In scientific community, a very question people like to ask each other is “what do you do” or “what is your research about”. Interestingly, every time I said “I work on energy” or something like that, I was in trouble. Depending on the background of your fellow, they may have quite different perspectives on what energy is and what is energy research about: if you are talking to material scientist, they could think energy is all about developing better electrode materials which could result in high-performance batteries; if you are talking to chemist, they might think energy is basically about finding novel catalysts or reaction path which would turn CO2 into fossil fuels (this is exactly my girlfriend does); if you are talking to electric engineers, they might think energy is about resilient power grid which could accommodate more renewable generation; and so on so force. They are all correct in the sense that if they manage to fully unleash their research potential at industrial scale, the energy trilemma could be largely tackled. However, we have to admit that although scientists worldwide have achieved impressive progresses in these domains, the overall landscape of energy conversion and utilization has not changed since industrial revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/sankey_diagram1.png&#34; alt=&#34;sankey_diagram&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sankey diagram of 2016 energy use in U.S. clearly shows that the bulk of global energy consumption comes from fossil fuel, more importantly the energy conversion technologies (technologies converting raw materials into usable energy carrier, such as electricity, for end users) are basically power plant and refineries. Even more, it could be projected that nothing would change in near future, unless disruptive technology breakthrough happens, for example artificial photosynthesis power plant at the scale of current fossil fuel power plant is successfully implemented. In such a context, I personally think it is very important to unleash the potential from intra-system re-innovation, I mean given no fundamental changes of component level performance leap, some priority should be given to system level design and optimization which would make the performance of each single component at their best value. Of course, this is not easy because on one side, the energy system landscape (what technologies are used, how they are designed and operated etc.) has been there for decades with high techno-institutional inertial that are quite difficult to overcome; on the other side, I think this research direction has not been paid much attention compared to other aspects. Many researchers do not give this a shit because they think energy system design and optimization is a super engineered or (so-called applied) research without scientific meanings, sequentially no publication on Nature, Science. This is correct, and this is not correct. This is correct because there is no scientific community that specialized on this topic, energy researchers are from various backgrounds with their own basis, so they only justify the soundness of their basis; this is not correct because more and more people are getting serious about system-level innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To be continued &amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Eco Industrial Park</title>
      <link>/project/eco-industrial-park/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Based on the concept of industrial symbiosis, which describes the combination of physically or virtually connected businesses within a certain area in a mutually beneficial way, the concept of Eco Industrial Park (EIP) has been brought forward to achieve maximum productivity with minimum cost of resources. Indeed, an EIP could be among the most energy-intensive areas of a country, correspondingly waste heat will also account for a considerable proportion. For instance, it is reported that the Yeosu National Industrial Complex in South Korea consumes 15% of the total energy of the country, while producing 47% of the total industrial waste heat. In EIP the geographical proximity between different users offers new possibilities for WHR; in fact, some waste heat that does not have end-user in one plant may be used in another, therefore WHR network can be formulated. In such cases, the plant supplying heat is defined as source plant, whereas the plant receiving heat is defined as sink plant. Besides, if the waste heat from source plants can be used by neighboring communities, the overall energy efficiency of EIP can be further improved through urban-industrial symbiosis. The optimization of WHR network at EIP level (inter-plant) is quite different from the optimization of WHR at single plant level (intra-plant). Currently the popular method used for WHR optimization in EIP is linear/nonlinear programming based on objective functions and constrains. The current research activity still presents room to improve in the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The multiple criteria decision-making. Various objective functions, including energy efficiency of the EIP, payback period of the WHR network, CO2 emission reduction etc. have been proposed in the literature, as a result different WHR network scenarios can be selected. Yet the attempt to satisfy multiple and possibly conflicting objectives simultaneously is seldom discussed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The analysis of waste heat transportation system. The temperature drop and energy loss during waste heat transportation has been mentioned in some papers, yet the configuration of the waste heat transportation system has not been discussed in detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The influence of intermittent waste heat on the optimization process. Almost all existing studies assume constant waste heat profile, but this may not be the case for some batch processes. For such processes, the waste heat profile could vary over time, thus influencing the performance of the WHR network; therefore, the intermittency of waste heat also merits to be investigated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
