      <description>In scientific community, a very question people like to ask each other is “what do you do” or “what is your research about”. Interestingly, every time I said “I work on energy” or something like that, I was in trouble. Depending on the background of your fellow, they may have quite different perspectives on what energy is and what is energy research about: if you are talking to material scientist, they could think energy is all about developing better electrode materials which could result in high-performance batteries; if you are talking to chemist, they might think energy is basically about finding novel catalysts or reaction path which would turn CO2 into fossil fuels (this is exactly my girlfriend does); if you are talking to electric engineers, they might think energy is about resilient power grid which could accommodate more renewable generation; and so on so force.</description>

      <description>Based on the concept of industrial symbiosis, which describes the combination of physically or virtually connected businesses within a certain area in a mutually beneficial way, the concept of Eco Industrial Park (EIP) has been brought forward to achieve maximum productivity with minimum cost of resources. Indeed, an EIP could be among the most energy-intensive areas of a country, correspondingly waste heat will also account for a considerable proportion. For instance, it is reported that the Yeosu National Industrial Complex in South Korea consumes 15% of the total energy of the country, while producing 47% of the total industrial waste heat.</description>
